# Gitpod Flex Demo: Streaming Platform Development Environment

![Gitpod Logo](https://gitpod.io/static/media/gitpod-logo.1b98a4d9.svg)

Welcome to the Gitpod Flex demo! This repository showcases how Gitpod Flex can transform your development workflow by providing a fully-configured, cloud-based development environment for a streaming platform (think Netflix-like service).

## üöÄ What is Gitpod?

Gitpod is a cloud development environment that:

- Instantly spins up pre-configured development environments
- Eliminates "works on my machine" problems
- Enables consistent development experiences across teams
- Reduces setup time from hours to seconds
- Provides a secure, isolated environment for each developer

## üé¨ Demo Overview

This demo showcases a streaming platform with multiple microservices, demonstrating how Gitpod Flex can handle complex development environments. You'll see:

- A modern streaming platform UI (Gitpodflix)
- A development environment visualization dashboard
- Multiple backend microservices
- Database integration
- Automated testing
- Real-time service monitoring

## üéØ Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Explore the Development Environment

1. **Start Gitpod**

   - Click the "Open in Gitpod" button above
   - Watch as Gitpod automatically provisions your development environment

2. **View the Development Dashboard**
   - Navigate to the development environment visualization
   - Observe the real-time service graph showing all microservices
   - Notice how services communicate and interact

### 2. Modify and Observe Changes

1. **Adjust Automation Configuration**

   - Open `.gitpod.yml`
   - Modify service configurations
   - Watch how changes affect the running environment

2. **Interact with the Streaming Platform**
   - Browse the Gitpodflix interface
   - Search for content
   - Create a user profile
   - Add items to your watchlist

### 3. Development Workflow Demonstration

1. **Make Code Changes**

   - Modify a service's functionality
   - See changes reflected in real-time
   - Test the modified service

2. **Run Tests**

   - Execute unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - View test coverage reports

3. **Running Tests with Gitpod CLI**
   You can run tests both from inside and outside the development environment using the Gitpod CLI:

   From outside the environment:

   ```bash
   # List available environments
   gitpod environments list

   # SSH into the environment
   gitpod ssh <workspace-id>

   # Run tests using automation
   gitpod automations task start runTests
   ```

   From inside the environment:

   ```bash
   # Run tests using automation
   gitpod automations task start runTests
   ```

### 4. Advanced Features

1. **Database Operations**

   - View database schemas
   - Run migrations
   - Seed sample data

2. **Service Monitoring**
   - Monitor service health
   - View communication patterns
   - Analyze performance metrics
