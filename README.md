### 🚀 Getting Started is a Breeze

We believe happy developers create better products, which is why we've eliminated the frustrating "works on my machine" syndrome that plagues traditional development. We've embraced Gitpod and this revolutionary approach means you can skip the tedious setup and start coding on day one - **yes, you can ship your first fix today!**

1. **Click this link** (or open the PR you were assigned)
2. **That's it!** Seriously, that's all you need to do.

2. Open [http://localhost:3002/api/movies](http://localhost:3002/api/movies) to see the movies API
3. Make changes and see them reflected immediately

It feels just like local development, but everything is running in your Gitpod environment.

### ♻️ Connecting to Gitpod and running unit tests

From outside your environment:

```bash
# List available environments
gitpod environments list

# SSH into the environment
gitpod ssh <workspace-id>

# Run tests using automation
gitpod automations task start runTests
```

From inside your environment:

```bash
# Run tests using automation
gitpod automations task start runTests
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Configuration

### DevContainer

The development environment configuration lives in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. This file defines:

- All required dependencies and packages
- Development tools and extensions
- Environment variables
- Container settings

To add new dependencies or development tools:

1. Edit `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
2. Add your new packages to the appropriate section
3. Restart your development container to apply changes

### Automations

The automation configuration is defined in `.gitpod/automations.yaml`. This file contains:

- Microservice definitions and configurations
- Development workflows
- Automated tasks and scripts
- Environment setup procedures

To add a new microservice or automation:

1. Edit `.gitpod/automations.yaml`
2. Define your new service or automation
3. Follow the existing patterns for consistency
4. Test your changes in a development environment
