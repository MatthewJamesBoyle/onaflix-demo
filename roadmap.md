# Gitpod Demo Roadmap

This document outlines future features and enhancements planned for the Gitpod demo environment. These improvements aim to showcase Gitpod's capabilities in various scenarios and provide a more engaging and comprehensive demonstration experience.

## Small fixes

- [x] Create a devcontainer best practices file
  - [x] Include mention of using features where possible
- [ ] Update README with instructions on showing terminal commands
- [ ] Update README with images of Gitpod Flex UI
- [ ] Update README with "things to try as you onboard"

## Future Demo Features

### Onboarding task / service

Create an interactive onboarding experience that guides users through the Gitpod environment using a wizard-like interface, which would automatically walk users through key features and capabilities by displaying a series of prompts, commands, and explanations that users can follow along with or execute directly. This guided tour would demonstrate how to use the terminal, access preview applications, work with the editor, manage ports, interact with Git repositories, and customize the workspace, all while providing contextual information about what's happening behind the scenes. The script could pause at key moments to allow users to experiment with what they've learned, offer suggestions for next steps, and adapt based on user interactions, creating a dynamic, hands-on demonstration that showcases Gitpod's value while simultaneously teaching new users how to be productive in the environmentâ€”essentially combining documentation, tutorial, and interactive demo into a seamless onboarding flow that makes the learning curve much gentler for newcomers and provides a consistent demonstration experience for presenters.

### rm -rf task

Create a task that demonstrates Gitpod's workspace isolation by safely executing destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. This will showcase how containerization provides complete isolation from the host system and other workspaces, highlighting Gitpod's security model and allowing developers to experiment freely without risk to their local machine or other environments. The demonstration will emphasize workspace isolation, safe experimentation, container-based security, and workspace recovery capabilities. This also highlights the ephemerality nature of Gitpod - users can intentionally destroy their environment knowing they can instantly create a fresh one, demonstrating how Gitpod enables developers to throw away and recreate environments at will without concern.

### Environment Sharing

Enable real-time interaction between presenters and viewers with live preview environments. This feature would allow participants to directly interact with the running preview application, making the demo more engaging and interactive. It showcases Gitpod's collaborative development capabilities and how teams can work together in real-time.

### Dotfiles

Demonstrate how users can personalize their development environment through dotfiles. This would show the flexibility of Gitpod in allowing developers to maintain their preferred development environment configurations across different workspaces.

### Secrets

Implement Gitpod OIDC integration for secure secrets management. This would showcase how sensitive information can be securely handled within Gitpod workspaces, demonstrating enterprise-grade security features.

### Automations Ready Probes

Enhance the automation configuration with sophisticated probes. This would demonstrate advanced workspace management capabilities, showing how Gitpod can intelligently handle workspace lifecycle events and resource management.

### Backstage Integration

Create an example of Gitpod integration with Backstage as an Internal Developer Platform. This would demonstrate how Gitpod fits into a larger developer experience platform, showing the onboarding process and integration capabilities.

### Analytics and Value

Develop a value demonstration dashboard that showcases time savings and business value metrics. This would serve as a powerful conclusion to the demo, highlighting the concrete benefits and ROI of using Gitpod in development workflows.
