# Gitpod Demo Roadmap

This document outlines future features and enhancements planned for the Gitpod demo environment. These improvements aim to showcase Gitpod's capabilities in various scenarios and provide a more engaging and comprehensive demonstration experience.

## Small fixes

- [x] Create a devcontainer best practices file
  - [x] Include mention of using features where possible
- [ ] Update README with instructions on showing terminal commands
- [ ] Update README with images of Gitpod Flex UI
- [ ] Update README with "things to try as you onboard"
- [ ] Script the auto port opening in an automation
- [ ] Add the port opening information to the README ("how to collaborate")

## Future Demo Features

### Onboarding task / service

Create an interactive guided tour that walks users through Gitpod's key features. This wizard-like interface would provide prompts and commands to demonstrate terminal usage, preview applications, editor features, port management, Git workflows, and workspace customization. The experience would adapt to user interactions, creating a hands-on demonstration that teaches new users while providing a consistent demo experience for presenters.

### rm -rf task

Create a task demonstrating Gitpod's workspace isolation with destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. This showcases containerization security, allowing safe experimentation without risk to local machines. It also highlights Gitpod's ephemerality - environments can be destroyed and recreated instantly without concern.

### Environment Sharing

Enable real-time interaction between presenters and viewers with live preview environments. This feature would allow participants to directly interact with the running preview application, making the demo more engaging and interactive. It showcases Gitpod's collaborative development capabilities and how teams can work together in real-time.

### Dotfiles

Demonstrate how users can personalize their development environment through dotfiles. This would show the flexibility of Gitpod in allowing developers to maintain their preferred development environment configurations across different workspaces.

### Secrets

Implement Gitpod OIDC integration for secure secrets management. This would showcase how sensitive information can be securely handled within Gitpod workspaces, demonstrating enterprise-grade security features.

### Automations Ready Probes

Enhance the automation configuration with sophisticated probes. This would demonstrate advanced workspace management capabilities, showing how Gitpod can intelligently handle workspace lifecycle events and resource management.

### Hot reloading

Showcase the hot reloading feature by making changes to the application and seeing the changes reflected immediately in the preview environment.

### Backstage Integration

Create an example of Gitpod integration with Backstage as an Internal Developer Platform. This would demonstrate how Gitpod fits into a larger developer experience platform, showing the onboarding process and integration capabilities.

### Analytics and Value

Develop a value demonstration dashboard that showcases time savings and business value metrics. This would serve as a powerful conclusion to the demo, highlighting the concrete benefits and ROI of using Gitpod in development workflows.
