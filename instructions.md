# Gitpod Demo Project Specification

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a unique, novel demonstration of Gitpod Flex, showcasing its powerful capabilities for creating standardized, automated development environments. The project highlights Gitpod's ability to configure complex microservice architectures for a streaming platform, demonstrating how it can seamlessly set up and orchestrate a complete development stack with proper configuration and visualization across multiple interconnected services.

**In Scope**
- Creation of a dev container with complete JSON specification
- Development of automation files for each individual component
- Implementation of a simple, unique UI to visualize streaming platform services within the repository
- All configuration and code stored within the repository itself
- Simple implementation of microservices as demonstration components
- Minimalist approach to keep the demo straightforward and focused

**Out of scope**
- Resource provisioning outside the development environment
- Data use cases and data processing pipelines
- Integration with external cloud services
- Performance optimization for production environments

## Architecture Components

### Configuration files required

- **Dev Container Definition**: A complete development container configuration that standardizes the development environment
- **Automation Files**: Configuration files that define automated tasks and workflows within Gitpod

### Automation Services

1. **Frontend**: A modern web application that visualizes the streaming platform's development environment configuration
2. **Backend**: API service that provides streaming platform data and functionality to the frontend
3. **Database (inside the box)**: Persistent storage for streaming platform data
4. **Unit Testing**: Automated test execution within the Gitpod environment
5. **Database Seeding**: Automated population of the database with sample streaming content data

## Frontend Visualization Requirements

The frontend application must provide an interactive graph-based visualization that represents the streaming platform's development environment as a dynamic network of interconnected services. The visualization should include:

### Graph Representation
- Each service (content catalog, user management, recommendation engine, streaming service, analytics) represented as a distinct node in the graph
- Nodes should be visually distinct and labeled with their service names
- Interactive nodes that can be clicked to show detailed service information
- Ability to zoom and pan the graph for better navigation

### Service Communication Visualization
- Dynamic edges (lines) between nodes representing service-to-service communication
- Animated flow indicators showing the direction and volume of data transfer
- Real-time updates of communication patterns as services interact

### Database Integration
- Database node with visual representation of streaming content record count
- Dynamic visualization of database operations (reads/writes)
- Visual feedback when streaming content records are added or modified
- Connection lines showing data flow between services and database
- Interactive database node that allows users to click and directly add/modify streaming content through the interface

### Interactive Features
- Real-time updates of the graph as services start/stop
- Ability to simulate increased streaming load to visualize scaling effects

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Dev Container Setup
- Create the dev container configuration first as it's the foundation for all other components
- Define the base image and required extensions
- Configure environment variables

### 2. Database Service Implementation
- Set up the database container configuration
- Implement database seeding scripts

### 3. Backend Services Development

#### 3.1 Content Catalog Service (Catalog)
- Manage movie and TV show metadata
- Handle content categorization and tagging
- Implement search and filtering functionality
- Manage content availability by region
- Rationale: This service is the core of content discovery, managing all metadata about available content and enabling search/filter functionality.

#### 3.2 User Management Service (Identity)
- Handle user authentication and authorization
- Manage user profiles and preferences
- Track watch history and watchlist
- Handle parental controls and content restrictions
- Rationale: This service manages all user-related data and access control, essential for personalized experiences and content recommendations.

#### 3.3 Recommendation Engine (Recommend)
- Generate personalized content recommendations
- Track user viewing patterns
- Implement content similarity algorithms
- Manage recommendation freshness and diversity
- Rationale: This service drives user engagement by providing personalized content suggestions based on viewing history and preferences.

#### 3.4 Streaming Service (Stream)
- Handle video streaming session management
- Manage adaptive bitrate streaming
- Track playback quality metrics
- Handle content delivery network (CDN) coordination
- Rationale: This service manages the actual video streaming experience, ensuring smooth playback and optimal quality based on network conditions.

#### 3.5 Analytics Service (Analytics)
- Track user engagement metrics
- Monitor streaming performance
- Collect viewing statistics
- Generate usage reports
- Rationale: This service provides insights into user behavior and system performance, helping improve the platform and user experience.

### 4. Frontend Development
- Implement the graph visualization using a library like D3.js or Cytoscape.js
- Create service node components with interactive features
- Develop real-time update mechanisms
- Rationale: The frontend can be developed once the backend API is stable, allowing for proper integration of real-time features and data visualization.

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up unit testing framework
- Implement test cases for each service
- Create integration tests for service interactions
- Rationale: Testing infrastructure is implemented after the core services are in place, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all components and their interactions.

### 6. Automation and Workflow
- Create Gitpod task configurations
- Implement service startup scripts
- Set up development workflow automation
- Rationale: Automation is implemented last as it depends on all other components being properly configured and tested, ensuring smooth development experience.
