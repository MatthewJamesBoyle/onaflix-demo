# Gitpod Demo Project Specification

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a unique, novel demonstration of Gitpod Flex, showcasing its powerful capabilities for creating standardized, automated development environments. The project highlights Gitpod's ability to configure complex microservice architectures, demonstrating how it can seamlessly set up and orchestrate a complete development stack with proper configuration and visualization across multiple interconnected services.

**In Scope**
- Creation of a dev container with complete JSON specification
- Development of automation files for each individual component
- Implementation of a simple, unique UI to visualize services within the repository
- All configuration and code stored within the repository itself
- Simple implementation of microservices as demonstration components
- Minimalist approach to keep the demo straightforward and focused

**Out of scope**
- Resource provisioning outside the development environment
- Data use cases and data processing pipelines
- Integration with external cloud services
- Performance optimization for production environments

## Architecture Components

### Configuration files required

- **Dev Container Definition**: A complete development container configuration that standardizes the development environment
- **Automation Files**: Configuration files that define automated tasks and workflows within Gitpod

### Automation Services

1. **Frontend**: A modern web application that visualizes the development environment configuration
2. **Backend**: API service that provides data and functionality to the frontend
3. **Database (inside the box)**: Persistent storage for application data
4. **Unit Testing**: Automated test execution within the Gitpod environment
5. **Database Seeding**: Automated population of the database with initial data

## Frontend Visualization Requirements

The frontend application must provide an interactive graph-based visualization that represents the development environment as a dynamic network of interconnected services. The visualization should include:

### Graph Representation
- Each service (frontend, backend, database, etc.) represented as a distinct node in the graph
- Nodes should be visually distinct and labeled with their service names
- Interactive nodes that can be clicked to show detailed service information
- Ability to zoom and pan the graph for better navigation

### Service Communication Visualization
- Dynamic edges (lines) between nodes representing service-to-service communication
- Animated flow indicators showing the direction and volume of data transfer
- Real-time updates of communication patterns as services interact

### Database Integration
- Database node with visual representation of record count
- Dynamic visualization of database operations (reads/writes)
- Visual feedback when database records are added or modified
- Connection lines showing data flow between services and database
- Interactive database node that allows users to click and directly add/modify data through the interface

### Interactive Features
- Real-time updates of the graph as services start/stop
- Ability to simulate increased database load to visualize scaling effects
